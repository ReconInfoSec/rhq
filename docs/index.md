Recon Hunt Queries
=========================================
Welcome to the Recon Hunt Queries repo! 
## About 
This project is proudly maintained by [Recon InfoSec](http://reconinfosec.com) to support the community of osquery users!

Our goal with this project is to have a consolidated place for **incident response & threat hunting** focused queries for **[osquery](https://github.com/osquery/osquery)**. We've grouped the queries by the [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Main_Page) tactics they support, but there are a few "General" categories of queries as well. Use the navigation bar on the top left to explore.

These are collections of **individual queries** for specific use cases, not query packs which are a [separate thing](https://www.darkbytes.com/osquery-scheduled-queries-packs/) altogether.

These queries are great for on-demand hunting across hundreds or thousands of systems via osquery [distributed queries](https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/stable/deployment/remote/) using a frontend like [Kolide Fleet](https://github.com/kolide/fleet).

There are several other great projects that track example queries, be sure to check them out!

- [osquery packs](https://github.com/osquery/osquery/tree/master/packs)
- [osquery queryhub](https://github.com/osquery/queryhub)

For a query that is universal across all supported osquery platforms, simply specify "All Platforms" as in the `tab`

If your query is only applicable to one platform, feel free to omit the non-applicable tabs.
